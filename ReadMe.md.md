<p>**</p>
<pre><code>16S gene sequencing has developed over the years to understand the microbial phylogeny and taxonomy using various diversity analysis techniques. This repository will focus on the usage of Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) in investigating how the environmental conditions such as pH, weather temperature and mineral levels affect the microbiome diversity in the soil samples collected from various location in the Gordon Square Park, London.

The data used is the result of Illumina sequencing of the genetic marker, 16S rRNA V4 region, that is found in the soil sample. For speedy analysis, high performance computer that is based in Amsterdam known as Cartesius is used for analysis by installing the QIIME environment into the server.
